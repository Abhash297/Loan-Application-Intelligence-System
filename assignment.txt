Assignment
Loan Application Intelligence System

Objective
Build an intelligent system that demonstrates your expertise in both classical machine
learning and modern AI/LLM capabilities using loan application data.

Overview
Create a system that:
1.​ Analyzes loan application data using ML-based classification and prediction
2.​ Builds an intelligent chatbot loan assistant that answers questions about loan data
3.​ Evaluates the quality and accuracy of AI-generated responses

Dataset
You can use any freely available loan application data.
For example,
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adarshsng/lending-club-loan-data-csv

Requirements
Part 1: Data Processing & ML Classification
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​

Load and analyze the provided loan application CSV dataset
Build a classifier to predict loan approval status
Achieve F1-score ≥ 0.75 on test set
Use traditional ML algorithms (your choice)
Implement proper train/test split and validation
Document feature engineering choices and model performance

Part 2: Intelligent Loan Assistant Chatbot

●​
●​
●​
●​

Make loan application data queryable by the chatbot
Build a REST API that allows users to ask questions about loans and applicants
Use the trained ML model to provide loan approval predictions
Implement your own retrieval logic (NO LangChain/LlamaIndex for retrieval
implementation)
●​ Use free/open-source LLMs (Ollama or Hugging Face)
●​ Return responses with source information and confidence metrics

Part 3: AI Evaluation & Metrics
●​ Create an evaluation dataset with 10-15 test questions covering diverse query types
●​ Include factual, aggregation, comparative, prediction, and unanswerable questions
●​ Design and implement appropriate evaluation metrics for:
○​ Retrieval quality
○​ Answer generation quality
○​ End-to-end system performance
●​ Provide analysis (0.5-1 page) of system performance, failure modes, and improvements

Bonus Points

🌟

Graph-Based Knowledge Representation
●​ Build a knowledge graph from loan application data
●​ Implement graph-based retrieval for the chatbot
●​ Compare performance against your base implementation

Domain Ontology Development
●​ Develop a formal ontology for the loan application domain
●​ Document your ontology design and rationale
●​ Demonstrate how it improves system reasoning

Deliverables
1. Code
Choose one format:

●​ Option A: Jupyter Notebook with clear sections and explanations
●​ Option B: Structured Python project

2. Documentation
●​ README.md: Setup, usage, architecture, and design choices
●​ EVALUATION_REPORT.md: ML performance, evaluation metrics, analysis, and
methodology

3. Demo Materials
●​ Example queries and responses
●​ Visualizations (optional but encouraged)

4. Artifacts
●​
●​
●​
●​

Trained ML model
Evaluation results
Test questions with ground truth
requirements.txt

Constraints
●​ Language: Python preferred (notify us if using another language)
●​ Free tools only: Use open-source models and libraries (no paid APIs like GPT-4,
Claude API)
●​ No frameworks for retrieval: LangChain/LlamaIndex can be used for LLM prompting
only, NOT for retrieval implementation

Timeframe
●​ Deadline: Complete within 7 days of receiving this assignment
●​ Expected Effort:
○​ Core requirements: 3-4 hours
●​ Notify us if you cannot complete within the timeframe

Important Notes

⚠️ Critical Requirements:
1.​ Implement retrieval logic yourself

2.​ Design comprehensive evaluation metrics
3.​ Provide measurable results with concrete numbers
4.​ Production-quality code with documentation
